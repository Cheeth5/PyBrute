# Password Cracking Suite

A simple GUI application for brute-force password cracking. This application is built with Python using the `tkinter` library for the GUI and the `hashlib` library for SHA-256 hashing.

## Features
- Brute-force attack to crack SHA-256 hashed passwords.
- Modern GUI with a custom background and styling.
- Logs all activities and errors.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-cracking-suite.git
    cd password-cracking-suite
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Enter the SHA-256 hash of the password you want to crack.
2. Click the "Crack Password" button.*
3. The application will attempt to brute force the password and display the result in a custom message box.

## Example
To test the application, you can use the following hash which corresponds to the password `a`: 'ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb"
